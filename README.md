## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod brings Yeslick from Baldur's Gate to BGII: SoA and ToB, with an extensive variety of banters and interjections, a new kit (Alaghor of Clangeddin) as well as a number of PC dialogues throughout the game. Yeslick is an older dwarf, a devotee of Vergadain, dwarven god of wealth and luck and Clangeddin, dwarven god of war and battle.

He tends to model himself as the father-figure of the group, and can often be found trying to help the party to reach their potential... to mixed results. He has a kind heart and a steady hand, and is loyal to the PC to the end.

>*When asked about his past, Yeslick chuckles grimly. "There ain't nothin' there ye be wantin' to know, young 'un. Trust me." From what you have gleaned, Yeslick is peculiar for a dwarf; a follower of Vergadain, the Dwarven god of wealth and luck and Clangeddin, Dwarven god of war, he is an unassuming companion with an aversion to alcohol and the undead. You know little about his history beyond that he grew up in the Dales to the north and that heat makes him extremely irritable.*

For people who remember Yeslick in Baldur's Gate, the authors have made the decision that the dwarf may still cast his Dispel Magic ability in SoA-ToB. :smile:

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

The Yeslick NPC mod should be compatible with all WeiDU mods, however, we cannot test every single one. It is only compatible with BGII: ToB. If you do encounter an error, please contact <a href="kae@spellholdstudios.net">K'aeloree</a> or alternatively post on the <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/609-yeslick/">forums</a>.

>Please install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a>. Some parts of the mod may not work correctly without it.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-yeslicknpc.exe`**, un-install the previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: yeslicknpc folder.</em>

<em>When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.</em>

**Disable any antivirus** or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: yeslicknpc folder and a setup-yeslicknpc.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-yeslicknpc.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-yeslicknpc.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the component settings.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-yeslicknpc --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="components" id="components"></a>Components

As of v3.0, the installer splits main component into two sub components, letting the player decide if he wants Yeslick to be an Alaghor of Clangeddin Fighter-Priest or not.  
The number of each is the component DESIGNATED number which gives it a fixed install position and allows automated installers to specify component choices.<br /><br />


**0. Yeslick is a regular Fighter-Cleric**  
**1. Yeslick is a Fighter-Alaghor of Clangeddin (Cleric kit)**

## <a name="versions" id="versions"></a>Versions History

##### Versions 4.0 (18 April 2020)

- Fixed EET install.

## 

##### Versions 3.0 (February 24, 2020)

- <ins>Major updates</ins>:
	- Added *yeslicknpc.ini* metadata file to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".
	- Components: added `DESIGNATED` numbers and "*yeslick_npc_bg2_fighter-cleric*" and "*yeslick_npc_bg2_alaghor_of_clangeddin*" `LABELS`.
	- Made Yeslick an Alaghor of Clangeddin Fighter-Priest an optional subcomponent.
	- EE games: included Aquadrizzt's qd_multiclass which installs multiclass kits in the Enhanced Infinity Engine (v2.0+). It enables multiclass kits to both appear properly in character creation and apply the appropriate bonuses during character advancement. Thanks Aquadrizzt and Subtledoctor!
	- Renamed LK#YK kit id to LK_ALAGHOR.
	- Increased Yeslick XP to fit game standards: 110 000 XP (F6-C7) in SoA and 2 500 000 (F13-C13) in ToB. Accordingly updated his HP, stats and spells (known and memorized).
	- Fixed Yeslick .cre files: effects updated to v2, removed inaccurate memorized druidic spells (:astonished:), and a few minor glitches.
	- Removed ADD_KIT process by script and added kit value into .cre files (by patch).
	- Converted inventory BAMs to EE: This feature attempts to modify traditional inventory BAMs so that both the large and small icons are utilized by the EE games. The inventory BAM must have two sequences, the first containing the "large" inventory icon frame and the second containing the "small" inventory icon frame to be processed. Inventory icon BAMs in the bam folder that meet these requirements are patched and saved back to the override folder.
	- Externalized tp2 code into *main_component.tpa* library for more comfortable readability and maintenance.
	- Included Linux and Mac Os X versions in the same package (thanks AL|EN's Infinity Auto Packager tool!).
	- Uploaded mod to official Spellhold Studios GitHub mirror account.

	- Fixed Yeslick portraits in EE games.
	- New icon for *Holy Symbol of Clangeddin* (thanks Lava).
	- Fixed *Holy Symbol of Clangeddin* restriction flags.
	- Fixed *Spiritual Axe* which now deals 1d8 damage (half slashing and magic).
	- Renamed LK#YK kit id to LK_ALAGHOR.
	- Fixed `ADD_KIT` process: now, Alaghor of Clangeddin kit is restricted to Lawful Neutral and Lawful Good as per description. Added missing lower case kit name.
	- Added abilities descriptions (EE games).
	- Removed useless `NAME2` and `DESC` spells strings.
	- Added missing `REQUIRE_PREDICATE` process to avoid installing the mod in inaccurate games.
	- `README` command now accepts translated files.
	- Updated English translation for compatibility with GW_UPDATE_ITM_DESCRIPTION_TO_EE WeiDU function requirements which automatically removes usability restrictions for EE games ; and integrated BWP Fixpack tokens typos fix.
	- Split setup.tra file into separate thematic files for more comfortable readability.
	- `Updated deprecated modding tools links.
	- Updated, re-formatted and renamed readme file to *yeslicknpc-readme-english.html*.
